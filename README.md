# Password Generator

## About This Project

This is a simple password generator application that allows users to create strong, secure passwords that meet certain requirements.

## Features

### Password Validation
- Checks if the user's input password meets the required length (at least 10 characters)
- Ensures the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Provides feedback to the user if the password does not meet the requirements

### Password Generation
- Generates a random password that meets the requirements (at least 10 characters, with at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character)
- Allows the user to choose between using the randomly generated password or modifying their own password

### Password Modification
- If the user's input password does not meet the requirements, the application offers the option to modify the password
- The application will automatically add random characters to the end of the user's password until it meets the requirements

### User-Friendly Interface
- The application provides clear and concise prompts to guide the user through the password generation process
- Error messages and warnings are displayed when the user's input does not meet the requirements

## Installation

To use the Password Generator project, follow these steps:

```cmd

## Usage

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a password. If the password does not meet the requirements, the script will display a warning and ask you if you want to use a random password or modify the existing one.

If you choose to use a random password, the script will generate a new password that meets the requirements and display it. If you choose to modify the existing password, the script will add random characters to the end of the password until it meets the requirements, and then display the modified password.
